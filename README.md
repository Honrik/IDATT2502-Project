# IDATT2502-Project
The project of Henrik Gulbrandsen Nilsen and Olav Asprem where they explore different reinforcement learning algorithms within this external [flappy bird gymnasium environment](https://github.com/markub3327/flappy-bird-gymnasium). We highly recommend going through the action and state space for this repo, aswell as how the rewards are calculated.

There are 3 main algorithms implemented, DQN, DDQN and PPO.
The DQN and DDQN code is based on this [repo](https://github.com/johnnycode8/dqn_pytorch/tree/main) by Johnny Code. He also has an amazing youtube series explaining the basic theory behind DQN and DDQN. 
The PPO code is based on this [repo](https://github.com/philtabor/Youtube-Code-Repository/tree/master/ReinforcementLearning/PolicyGradient/PPO/torch).

Using the existing code as a good baseline, countless of tests and tweaks have been made in an attempt to optimize the result.
